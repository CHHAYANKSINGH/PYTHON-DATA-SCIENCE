1)How are "collection" variables different from normal variables?
  Collection variables can store multiple values in a single variable
2)What are the Python keywords used to construct a loop to iterate through a list?
  for/in
3)For the following list, how would you print out 'Sally'? friends = [ 'Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
  print friends[2]
4)fruit = 'Banana' fruit[0] = 'b'; print fruit
  Nothing would print the program fails with a traceback
5)Which of the following Python statements would print out the length of a list stored in the variable data?
  print len(data)
6)What type of data is produced when you call the range() function? x = range(5)
  A list of integers
7)What does the following Python code print out? a = [1, 2, 3]; b = [4, 5, 6]; c = a + b; print len(c)
  6
8)Which of the following slicing operations will produce the list [12, 3]? t = [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15]
  t[2:4]
9)What list method adds a new item to the end of an existing list?
  append()
10)What will the following Python code print out? friends = [ 'Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally' ]; friends.sort(); print friends[0]
  Glenn

8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() function. The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.
You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/romeo.txt

fname = input("Enter file name: ")
if len(fname) == 0:
    fname = 'romeo.txt'
fh = open(fname)
lst = list()
for line in fh:
    for i in line.split():
		if not i in lst:
			lst.append(i)
lst.sort()
print(lst)

8.5 Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message). Then print out a count at the end.
Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'.
You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt

fname = input("Enter file name: ")
if len(fname) < 1 : fname = "mbox-short.txt"

fh = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fh:
	if not line.startswith('From'):continue
	line = line.split()
	if line[0] == 'From':
    	count = count +1    
    	print(line[1])
		
print("There were", count, "lines in the file with From as the first word")
